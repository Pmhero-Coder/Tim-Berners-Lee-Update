                Hi, my name is Pratyush Mohanty, a 10 year old who goes to Mccoy Elementary. My all time favourite sport is table tennis. I also love reading books and few of them include Harry Potter, Fablehaven, and Wings of Fire. We all love talking about memories , so some of my favorite memories include strolling the streets of Las Vegas and getting my Texas state championship second-place trophy.

                My future aspirations is to be an astronaut. I want to discover something new in space.

                Pratyush Mohanty, Thatâ€™s me</p>
